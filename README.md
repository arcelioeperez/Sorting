# Sorting Algorithms  

There are many variations and more sorting algorithms, but I decided to present
the following as an overview. If you would like to learn or know about other
algorithms please refer to the [Citation](#Citation).  

Since C and C++ share some similarities, the only difference in the solutions is that the C++
solutions will be done using classes and objects. Additionally instead of arrays,
the C++ solutions will also be done using vectors.  

*This is a work in progress!*

- [Insertion Sort O(n^2)](C/insertion_sort.c)        
- [Merge Sort O(n log n)](C/merge_sort.c)      
- [Quick Sort O(n log n)](C/quick_sort.c)   
- [Selection Sort O(n^2)](C/selection_sort.c)
