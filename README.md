# Sorting Algorithms  

There are many variations and more sorting algorithms, but I decided to present
the following as an overview. If you would like to learn or know about other
algorithms please refer to the [Citation](#Citation).  

Since C and C++ share some similarities, the only difference in the solutions is that the C++
solutions will be done using classes and objects - additionally instead of arrays
the C++ solutions will also be done using vectors.  

**Sorting Algorithms in C**    

Average Time Complexities     
 
- Insertion Sort O(n^2)      
- Merge Sort O(n log n)    
- Quick Sort O(n log n)    
- Selection Sort O(n^2)     
- Bubble Sort O(n^2)
